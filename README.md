Diego Carvalho is an associate professor in Production Engineering Coordination under the Higher Education Department at the Federal Centre for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET/RJ). He earned his undergraduate degree in Production Engineering from the Polytechnic School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and his Doctorate in Systems Engineering and Computer Science from PESC/COPPE. He also teaches at the Graduate Programme of Production and Systems Engineering and the Graduate Programme in Computer Science. He serves as head of the Higher Education Department at CEFET/RJ.

He worked at the DELPHI Experiment (CERN) as a computer scientist expert in Complex Distributed Real-Time Data Acquisition & Control Systems. He was a project manager in several object-oriented software development projects sponsored by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil).

He was amongst the leading researchers of grid computing projects from 2005 to 2011, when he participated in several e-Science projects funded by the European Commission, including EELA, EELA-2, and GISELA. Those e-Science projects provided computing resources to researchers from Europe and Latin America with the support of the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI). He also contributed to porting applications to the grid infrastructure and developed the Industry@Grid application, an industrial grid computing application that eases the product mix problem with stochastic optimization.

In his home institution, he worked in several administrative positions. He was the head of the Department of Production Engineering (DEPRO). He coordinated the undergraduate course in Production Engineering, and he has been the pro-rector of budget and management in CEFET-RJ for three years.

His professional experience covers diverse areas such as object-oriented design, distributed systems, network engineering, parallel architectures, grid technologies, data mining, and big data. He is a Senior Member of IEEE and a member of the Internet Society.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on scientific workflows, AI, data mining, public transport models, and mobility.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning non-Normal statistics, temporal series, C++, Python, and Julia
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, please correct me if I use the wrong one with you. I do respect you.
